Currency transactions (3DCoins, Tokens) are not the only data components of the Districts ecosystem, the management of the 3D world Objects and the Decentralized applications require their own specific transactions, both of them need to have a decentralized storage and rapid delivery, two essentials that the 3DCoin blockchain offers.



#### How can all transactions be instantaneous?

Transactions are confirmed by a consensus among nodes before the mining of a block thanks to the **Real time outputs list**, this list is held and filled by all master nodes simultaneously, one same transaction by one, after gathering signed validation votes from each other. nodes that cast votes disagreeing with the overwhelming majority will be banned from the network.

Once the 5 minutes trigger engaged, the Real time outputs list will be part of the newly mined block.



#### What is the network status system?

It's a set of lists (To which the Real time outputs list belong) hosted by all nodes, unanimity votes are used to track
