# **FAQ:**



#### Why are there three layers to the 3DCoin blockchain?

Currency transactions (3DCoins, Tokens) are not the only data components of the Districts ecosystem, the management of the 3D world Objects and the Decentralized applications require their own specific transactions, both of them need to have a decentralized storage and rapid delivery, two essentials that the 3DCoin blockchain offers.

#### What is the network status system?

It's a set of lists (To which the Real time outputs list belongs) hosted by all nodes. Unanimity votes are used to track different stats (Nodes performance, Node payment order, Transactions validity) 

Votes are signed like every message in the network, and are consequently impossible to forge, meaning that each node has the entire responsibility for the validity of its votes, which justifies the strict policy against disrupting behaviors.

#### Can the 3DCoin network gather data that is external to it?

Indeed, transactions can be API powered, allowing the largest spectrum of smart contracts.

#### How many 3DCoin are going to be created?

There are actually 68.143.706 3DC (62 millions initially, after the ICO) that have been created, and the maximum will be 86 millions.

#### Is there a way to have passive income from the network?

Helping the growth of the network and the execution of its functionalities by setting up a node (Master, prime, pulse) will come with a reward at the mining of each block. The payment goes through a cycle where nodes are ordered in a list, every five minute, the node at the top of the list will get the 16 3DC that come with the mining of the block, then will get relegated to the bottom of the list.

#### Does 3DC mining require allot of energy or powerful hardware?

The mining being done through Proof of service and not proof of work, the requirement will be minimal, a simple VPS will suffice.

#### What will be the collateral for node setup?

It will be 25.000 3DC, and will only be locked during the initial access of the node to the payment list, once it reaches the top of the list and  receives the first payment, the 25.000 will be free again without the loss of the node status. 

#### What is special about the 3DC mining system?

It has neither the resources requirements of the proof of work (this explains the absence of Bits and Nonce from block headers), nor the constraint of having money locked down as a collateral to keep the node running as it is in the proof of stake, while maintaining the impossibility of forks, it is fast, safe, ecological.

#### How can all transactions be instantaneous?

Transactions are confirmed by a consensus among nodes before the mining of a block thanks to the **Real time outputs list**, this list is held and filled by all master nodes simultaneously, one same transaction by one after gathering signed validation votes from each other and getting synchronized.

Transactions are thus instantly confirmed and rendered spendable before getting in the blockchain, and once the 5 minutes trigger is engaged, the Real time outputs list will be part of the newly mined block. 

#### The merkle root is replaced .. by?

There are still roots in blocks, but the hashing order is different. Instead of a merkle tree, where hashing is done by Tx pairs, the 3DCoin root comes from a "merkle" stairs made with the **Real time outputs list **(next blocks transactions) as a base, and the hashing is done every time a new transaction is added.

#### Why should i acquire 3DCoins?

There are many reasons to that:

- 3DCoin is the official currency of the Districts 3D world and it will be needed for all the businesses running in it.
- 3DCoin will challenge all other cryptocurrencies with its new features as it constitutes a leap ahead in terms of smart contracts and decentralized applications possibilities, beside the infinitesimal resource requirements and transactions high speed, it will be preferred by investors and consumers, and will conquer the market.
