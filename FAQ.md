# **FAQ:**



#### Why are there three layers to the 3DCoin blockchain?

Currency transactions (3DCoins, Tokens) are not the only data components of the Districts ecosystem, the management of the 3D world Objects and the Decentralized applications require their own specific transactions, both of them need to have a decentralized storage and rapid delivery, two essentials that the 3DCoin blockchain offers.

#### How can all transactions be instantaneous?

Transactions are confirmed by a consensus among nodes before the mining of a block thanks to the **Real time outputs list**, this list is held and filled by all master nodes simultaneously, one same transaction by one, after gathering signed validation votes from each other. nodes that cast votes disagreeing with the overwhelming majority will be banned from the network.

Once the 5 minutes trigger engaged, the Real time outputs list will be part of the newly mined block.

#### What is the network status system?

It's a set of lists (To which the Real time outputs list belongs) hosted by all nodes. Unanimity votes are used to track different stats (Nodes performance, Node payment order, Transactions validity) 

Votes are signed like every message in the network, and are consequently impossible to forge, meaning that each node has the entire responsibility for the validity of its votes, which justifies the strict policy against disrupting behaviors.

#### Can the 3DCoin network gather data that is external to it?

Indeed, transactions can be API powered, allowing the largest spectrum of smart contracts.



#### Coin base

There are actually 68.143.706 3DC that have been produced, and the maximum will be 86 millions.
