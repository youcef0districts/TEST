##  **Abstract**

 The world has evolved into a fast-paced digitalized society, one where fluidity and ease of interaction take centre stage. Communication, social interaction, entertainment, and productivity are available at the push of a button. The caveat, however, is that the technologies that make this possible have in a bid to promote fluidity, cut out the traditional experiences formerly associated with these processes. More importantly, a dearth in scalable productive options and scarce resources have stymied the innovative process; brilliant ideas do not see daylight and of the handful that make it past the theoretical stage very few become successful enterprises.

 Project Districts is the world's first fully capable decentralized virtual ecosystem designed to project real-world and ethereal experiences to users all over the globe. Its robust architecture and highly competent development portal (the Districts Visual Studio), makes it the perfect candidate for bootstrapping real-world ideas and solutions. Districts is dissimilar from conventional virtual realities in that it is run and governed by its thriving community. Users who power the blockchain network by functioning as nodes hold the power to create and modify rules governing the ecosystem. Quite practically, its strength is in its numbers. It is this expansive number of users interconnected by the blockchain that has made Districts a hub for social interaction and innovation.

 In the Districts ecosystem, users can develop content, applications, and shared experiences for personal, public, or commercial use. Content created using District’s own personalized development tool – the Districts Visual Studio is commissioned into the ecosystem as a Decentralized Application or DAPP. Users exercise full control over their DAPPS and other intellectual properties in the Districts ecosystem. By default, all commissioned DAPPS are assigned a designated land parcel in the Districts 3D world. Users can also purchase and trade land arbitrarily for private or public use. Ownership and geographic location of a land parcel in the 3D world are defined by a smart script, localized in the Districts blockchain.

 Using this same blockchain technology is District’s native payment gateway and fully fledged cryptocurrency – 3DCoin; initially based on Bitcoin concept, and reinforced by additional legacy cryptic technologies.

##  **Introduction**

 A preface to Blockchain Technology LLC Projects Districts was founded under the umbrella of Blockchain Technology a limited liability company domiciled in the UAE. Blockchain Technology LLC on its own is an independent blockchain consortium with specific interests in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. Headquartered in Dubai, Blockchain Technology LLC is one of the very first Blockchain start-ups fully fledged in the Gulf States. The region which currently hosts a teeming population of approx. 51 million people, has until very recently been more or less segregated from the worldʼs blockchain and blockchain backed cryptocurrency drive. This is despite the fact that the region currently accounts for a significant proportion of global remittances, which in practice is one of the sectors blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are looking to reinforce with efficiency. This limited blockchain stakeholder participation and relatively unexplored market potential in the Gulf States, specifically the UAE, was key to the localization of Blockchain Technology LLC in Dubai. Our goal is to function as an industry leader and key influencer for the promulgation of Blockchain based technologies and cryptocurrencies to the vibrant economy of the UAE and the Arabian Peninsula at large. By collaborating with established foreign investors and global entities, Blockchain Technology LLC aims to bridge the theoretical gap that exists between the Worldʼs blockchain ecosphere and the potentially disruptive financial market of the Gulf States.

##  **Our Vision**

 Project Districts stemmed from a passion to create a boundless environment where real-world limitations and shortcomings are rendered invalid – In this world ‘possibility is the watchword. We wanted a system that nullified traditional barriers to innovation, one that went on to replace such limitations with the necessary tools needed to innovate, create and condensate ideas into workable solutions.

 To create this world, the Districts development team recruited the services of two innovative technologies, the blockchain, and Virtual Reality - each disruptive in its own right. Project Districts leverages the core efficiencies of these two pioneers of 21st-century innovation, to create an immersive virtual ecosystem, complete with virtualized real-life entities existing in a real-time interactive environment. This synergistic manipulation of the Blockchain and Virtual reality is an industry first, more importantly, however, it is one that allows us to integrate a diverse range of functionalities into the Districts 3D world.

 Ultimately, Project Districts will be a thoroughly robust ecosystem where productivity, recreation, and innovation come to roost, much similar to the real world, only this time without its associated complexities. Our goal is to be the worldʼs first ubiquitous interface for propagating traditional and ethereal experiences to both the everyday internet user and the tech-savvy geek.

##  **Escalating Virtual and Augmented Reality to new levels**

 In 1987, following successful demonstrations of what was then new-gen display technologies like ‘Headsightʼ ‘Videoplaceʼ and ‘Sword of Damocles,ʼ Jaron Lanier coined the term virtual reality to describe all technologies like the aforementioned that in very plain terms ‘virtualized reality.ʼ Three decades later and VR/AR are now championing a seismic change in how we perceive the world. Just last year, several newcomers including Sonyʼs critically acclaimed PlayStation VR, Googleʼs Daydream view headset, its Tango portable AR phone and Snapʼs Spectacle VR glasses debuted the VR/AR scene. Over 100 million VR headsets were sold, and quite impressively, Pokemon Go, the revolutionary AR based video game drove in over $1.2 billion in revenue. In that same year, the VR/AR industry cumulatively pulled in a total sum of $3.9 billion in revenues.

 These bubbling market indices are reflective of the immense potential contained in VR/AR ecosphere. Experts predict that come 2025, the VR/AR market would be worth well over $700 billion. 2025 is just a mere eight years away, and while $700 billion seems plausible, the sheer volume of participating stakeholders and the rapidity of VR/AR innovations springing up on the daily suggests otherwise. In the medical industry, for instance, VR is currently being used to treat a myriad of illnesses like anxiety, PTSD, and Autism – psychiatrists at the University of Louisville even use the tech to treat patients suffering from different kind of phobias.

 The problem, however, with existing VR/AR frameworks is that they are:

-  	Complex 	to manipulate – requiring an in-depth knowledge of existing 	technologies and frameworks. As a result, usage has been limited to 	only industry professionals and tech-savvy enthusiast.
-  	Expensive 	to set up – VR and AR worlds (with emphasis on the forme) require 	dedicated high-end infrastructures for hosting; most of which exceed 	the budget ceiling of the everyday consumer.
-  	Limited 	in terms of capabilities and applicable use cases

 Project Districts launches as the panacea for all three limitations; by exploiting the latent capabilities of the blockchain, Districts 3D world floats itself on a robust P2P system. The efficiency of this blockchain network severely cuts down traditional costs associated with setting up and running an AR/VR based ecosystem.

 Project Districts also comes with its own personalized developer tool – Districts Visual Studio (DVS). Districts Visual Studio is a specialized development module that presents the complex intricacies of the Districts 3D world in an easy to use interface which effectively bridges the technical gap between the 3D world and its users. With this tool, users whether computer savvy or not can create custom entities in the 3D ecosystem. Before the establishment of Districts, the only other custom decentralized app development platform based on the blockchain was Ethereum. Ethereum was however developed for developers. This deficit meant that the thriving community of VR/AR enthusiasts with a need for a fully decentralized system with 3D capabilities were left hanging – that is, until the advent of project Districts

##  **Use cases**

 What makes Project Districts truly unique is its versatility and immense capabilities. From the retailing industry where it is poised to deliver efficient and highly scalable retailing solutions, to the educational sector where we plan to implement the worldʼs first global and fully interactive classroom, down to the health sector, where health professionals will be given an avenue to create practical and effective therapies for the many neurodegenerative disorders – suffice it to say that the Districts train is one that will surely make a pit stop at every facet of human living.

##  **High-End Applications**

 Districts Visual Studio has native support for the development of a broad range of applications, which will be commissioned into the Districts ecosystem as a DAPP. A user-defined DAPP could be anything – it can be as basic as a virtual key or as complex as full-scale MMORPG – It all boils down to the needs and creative tendencies of the user. If your goal is to build another Districts ecosystem inside of the original Districts 3D world, fret not, Districts is built to support the most demanding and resource consuming DAPPS. Bolstered by the robust decentralized framework of the Blockchain and sailing the winds of our technical partners **[Unreal Engine](**[https://www.unrealengine.com](https://www.unrealengine.com/) **)** , Districts combines all the necessary technologies to provide a cocktail of digital excellence.

##  **Provision of Real World Utilities**

 Districts 3D world provides a solid basis for the establishment of enterprises that provide virtual value-added services that can be availed in real life. Business owners and entrepreneurs can set-up custom entities such as shopping malls, online virtual classrooms and even virtualized health facilities – as was with application development the extent of the business idea is only limited by the developing entity. And unlike conventional methods of starting up and running a business, the Districts business model scales through traditional limitations of exorbitant expenses, bureaucracy, and cumbersome regulations.

##  **Advertisement and Content Promotion**

 Districts immersive world provides a fertile ground for all forms of targeted advertising. Say a marketer is looking to advertise his gaming title, he/she can simply hoist up a virtual banner in any of Districtʼs virtual gaming environment. Similarly, billboards, posters, and fliers can be displayed at strategic positions in the 3D world; brands can also create virtual experiences geared towards advertising and marketing their products.

##  **Networking and Social Interaction**

 Districts would also be a place to meet new people. Users will be able to interact in real-time in the 3D world via custom-created avatars or through chats on the networkʼs forums and groups. Virtual concerts, shows, broadcasts, and parades can also be hosted in the 3D world

##  **The Districts Ecosystem**

 The focal point of the District ecosystem is its users. Straight from launch Districts will come with a predefined 3D world template complete with fundamental entities and architecture. It is atop this predefined model that users would be able to create their own custom entities using Districts visual studio (DVS). User-defined objects are commissioned into the districts ecosystem as flexible, decentralized applications or DAPPS Districtʼs 3D world is a miniverse of its own. What this means is that real life entities like other humans (users), business buildings, hospitals, schools, cinemas, etc. will exist as standalone entities with full interactive capabilities. So, unlike traditional VR and AR technologies that allow for localized visualization and in some rare instances, interaction; the Districts 3D world allows for visualization, interaction, and real-time participation with actual real-life consequences. Say a 3D world user walks into a shopping mall hosted in Districts 3D world and makes a purchase, he/she will receive a valid receipt of purchase and subsequent real-life delivery of such a product. This consequential nature of the Districts 3Dworld is what guarantees its place as the revolutionary virtual reality solution with use cases applicable to everyone. A doctor can treat his/her patient on Districts, so also can a gamer play his favourite games; a businessperson can set up the mall of his dreams with a fraction of the resources itʼd take to do so in real life. Whatever fits the preference of the user.

##  **Market opportunity**

 Three years ago virtual and augmented reality were just ‘workable ideas,ʼ today however on the back of both being revolutionary in impact some might describe them as the cherry topping of the 21st-century innovation drive. A quick performance analysis of the key players (counterpart technologies) like Oculus VR, HTC Vive, and Google cardboard reveals a steady improvement in operational capabilities and fiscal performance in the last two years; this is despite repeated technical setbacks within this same period. Project Districts comes into the VR/AR scene peering from the shoulders of these pioneer technologies. That said, Projects District is uniquely dissimilar from the first generation VR/AR tech. Unlike the latter which focus majorly on hardware development for the experience of a 3D world, Project Districts is that 3D world where all first gen VR/AR tech will demonstrate their use capabilities. This all-encompassing nature of Districts ultimately means that use cases of individual third party VR/AR technologies will be ported to the Districts Ecosystem.

 Aside from this potential integration with existent VR/AR tech Districtʼs own native collection of DAPPs is an investors delight. Since the Districts 3D world recreates all aspects of the real world, users can design virtual instances of real-world entities like malls, hospitals, and schools with real-world consequences. The import from this is that investors can invest in the development of profitable DAPPS that provide value in the Districts ecosystem much like they would in real life. Only this time at a fraction of the cost and without the correspondent risks.

 In a world where the costs and complexities of starting up a profitable entity continue to skyrocket, DAPPs represent the future of scalability and affordability. With regards to profitability, the profit margin of DAPPS when implemented will be significantly higher than traditional methods of undertaking businesses, since they run on a decentralized blockchain that eliminates traditional costs, expenses and barriers to business operations. At the official launch of Districts 3D world and subsequent to global adoption and user base growth, DAPPs will become the engine room of the Districts ecosystem.

 Fuelling this engine and serving as the official medium of transaction in the Districtʼs ecosystem is 3Dcoin – Project Districts own cryptocurrency. 3Dcoin is live on 02 April 2018 when it will be listed in global cryptocurrency exchanges. Fiscal predictions for 2018 Q4 hint to a more than proportional increase in the value of the cryptocurrency which unlike most other cryptocurrencies, is backed by a real-world entity – Project Districts.
As of July 2018, the 3DCoin coinbase is worth 62 million 3DC. 75% (47million 3DC) of this sum is dedicated to the ICO, which on completion will serve as an initial funding round for the project. The remaining 25% is split into four portions;

-  	10% 	for early investors (locked for one year)
-  	10% 	for the development team (locked for five years)
-  	4% 	for the Districts board of advisors (locked for one year).
-  	1% 	for the bounty campaign

 Given the already burgeoning demand for 3DCoin, and considering its fiat nature in the 3D world, one can only expect the best for the cryptocurrency in the world market come next year.

##  **Districts Shareholders/Revenue**

 Districts Universality and VR tech immersion make it an invaluable tool for investors looking to teleport their businesses into the next level of success. Investors can utilize their otherwise limited assets to create stunningly engaging and profitable content on the District framework. Because Districts incorporates VR technology, it is not subject to real-world limitations that make projects unsalable. Quite practically investors can transform their one-stop shops and businesses into diversified mega-malls with a broad range of profiteering ventures.

 Before the Districts release, a new token will be issued in 3DCoin Blockchain which represent a 100% of Districts shares, this shares will be distributed among the 3DCoin holders.

 Districts provide all the tools necessary to the user and help them start a business, design an online game or even a live concert for a one time fee of few 3DCs, this strategy will encourage new users to develop their dream projects in Districts.

 As a **marketplace**, when a merchant list his store in Districts 3D world he won't have to pay an additional cost to list and showcase their product but he must accept the escrow agreement which includes the percentage fees paid for every confirmed sale and protect both parties.

 As an **Advertising platform** the 3D world unlimited concept is what gives it the advantage because unlike the alternative platforms, Districts will give the users the possibility to create any form/shape of an ad and program it to speak and interact with clients directly.

 As a **Game**, Districts players can earn virtual items like avatars, weapons, ability items in form of tokens which can be also purchased from the Districts marketplace or other users. Developers can choose the free-to-play model to get profit from selling items or join the subscription pool offered by Districts where the player will pay a fixed fee monthly to get access to this games.

 The Districts shareholders token is a hard-coded smart contract that automatically distributes all transactions for each paid campaign, new subscriber, item sold, or ADS campaign placed in the 3D world of the Districts.

## Architecture: 3DCoin Blockchain**  

 3DCoin is an innovative cryptocurrency that relies on a **consensus protocol** to form a **multilayered** **architecture**. The network utilizes simple **scripts** to program **transactions** that in turn deploy contracts triggered by say, a timestamp or an external public API. **API** integration and implementation allow the 3Dcoin blockchain to verify and validate essential data originating from **external** **sources** as is a centralized public server or another blockchain.  

 

 3DCoin v0.14 is game changing and its features are the following :

 	**Triple layered blockchain** secured by the **synchronisation based** **proof of service** instead of **proof of work**, saving massive amounts of energy and hardware, with the impossibility for two valid blocks to be created at the same time, thus the impossibility of a 51% attack.

 	A network based on **three types** of specialized nodes (Master, Pulse, Prime) managing all aspects of the 3DCoin/Districts eccosystem.

 	A hashed **real time outputs** **list** allowing all transactions to be instantaneous with no extra cost.

 	A **network** **status system** that monitores updates in the nodes activity and listing, and tracks both simple transactions and script/API powered ones. Note that there are no miners.

## Transactions And blocks

 Transactions on the 3DCoin blockchain are specified to be unalterable and instantanious. The parsed script of each transaction and the API parameters determines how the transaction will be redeemed.

 Transactions can be used to facilitate any transfer (or store) of value, as is in token distributions, online betting game systems or a simple payment for your morning cup of coffee. They are also used for the management of the 3D world objects and the DAPPs throught scrtipted Tokens.

 Path in the system : When a transaction is broadcasted on the network, the new masternode architecture is set up to enable instant validation. It does this by rapidly relaying the transaction to other nodes. Each node will then broadcast a signed vote, which when reaching a majority, will confirm the transaction in the network Status system then place it in the The real time outputs list, rendering it spendable (UTXO), even before the Mining of the block to which it will belong with the rest of the list.

 **The real time outputs** **list** is hosted in every Master nodes memory and has a double purpose : the instant confirmation of transactions and the preparation of the next blocks transactions, being synchronized, transactions that it holds have the same level of authenticity as those in the blockchain. It is temporary and will be cleared everytime a block is created. It has an equivalent for Object Tokens in pulse nodes, and DAPP Tokens  in prime node. The master node being the host of the main blockchain, it holds the three them.

###  **Transaction types**

 **3DCoin transactions :** These are the currency holders, used to send and recieve 3DCoins or custom tokens, can both be simple or conditionned with scripts/API

**Object tokens :** In the Districts, each item identity and propreties will be stored in a specific Token as meta data (generated from Districts, colored coin model), saved in the Objects chain within every Pulse node, Object tokens can wield every possible entity and its characteristics (weapon, user name, portal, random number generator ...)

**DAPP tokens :** DAPP ownership and propreties, are also set in a token (generated by the DVS), saved in the DAPP chain within every Prime node.In the case of 3D DAPPs specific to the Districts world, the ownership and the precise geolocation (x, y, z coordinates) of the land recieving the DAPPs 3D structure are both included in the same token.

 **Tokens** are script powered transactions holding meta data, they serve as files, meaning that Object and DAPP **Tokens** have nothing to do with currency management. 

### **Roots**

 Unlike in the classic blockchain systems(BTC,DASH...), 3DCoin transactions are not placed at the base of a merkle root, but they are arranged into the The real time outputs list. The merkle root is created only after the reception of all the transactions to be integrated in the block, the RTOL list is hashed every time a transaction is added to it in all nodes, the final hash (3DCoin root) is what replaces the merkle root in the block. This change adds a new functionalty while keeping the same level of safety.

 

Note that these processes backed by the high-speed architecture of the 3DCoin blockchain happen in real time. The receiving party will instantly get notified by network mere seconds after the transaction is initiated. This speed is due to the fact that 3DCoin transactions are confirmed via the unique status early vote system, and placed in the UTXO.

## Blocks 

 A standard block, lets say a Bitcoin one, is made of a set of transaction from which a merkle root is produced. The identity of the block is then generated by the hashing of the merkle root together with the rest of the header data (version, previous block hash ...)

 

  The 3DCoin block in the other hand, being the synergizer of the three data sets that represent the Districts eccosystem (3DCoin transactions, 3D world object Tokens, DAPP Tokens), its header is made of the following data :

 Version, Pervious block hash, 3DCoin root, Objects root, DAPPs root, Timestamp.

 

 Note that there is no Difficulty target or nonce as the proof of work is no more used.Object and DAPP blocks are simpler :The three types of blocks being mined at the same time (5min interval), all the chains will have a similar number of blocks.

##  **Nodes and Chains**

 The 3DCoin network has three types of nodes; Masternodes, Primenodes, and Pulsenodes. Each one of these nodes has a specific task to perform. For a new node to attain the status of master or prime node, it must have more than 25000 3DC in its account. (pre v0,14 nodes will keep their previlege)This requirement acts as an anti spam collateral, The network actively assesses and verifies the efficiency of the node before it receives its first payment. If the verification fails, the masternode is temporarly banned and its owner notified of the disfunctions. The number of masternodes on the network is rate limited by the number of active primenodes on the network. Consequently, only 30* masternodes can exist for 1 primenode. The 25000 3DC collateral will be released once the node has recieved its first payment.

###  **Types **:

 **Masternodes** are in charge of verifying 3DCoin transactions, hosting the Real time outputs lists and a full copy of the 3DCoin blockchain , and mining 3DC blocks.Run the network status module.

 **Pulsenodes** on the other hand, are dedicated to validating Districts object tokens, hosting the Real time objects token list, the object chain, and the real time events in the Districts 3D world, thus serving as a bridge between clients and Prime nodes which run Dapps (3D world clients are not connected to Prime nodes directly). Run the network status module.

 **Primenodes** are concerned with hosting and running the DAPPs whether they are meant for districts or an external service (web site etc ...), facilitating user-to-dapp access by functioning as a Dapp Name System (DNS), storing storing the DAPP chain and mining DAPP blocks, and all side chains created on the 3DCoin platform by the users. Run the network status module. DAPPs are stored in data structures called Data Capsules, each one is referenced to a block in the DAPP chain and indexed in it.

 By removing the proof of work mechanism, this new architecture contributes to a huge savings in energy because it isn't a competition between miners, but a node cooperation (The bitcoin network consumes as much energy as Switzerland), it also avoids the huge hardware waste in term of CPU and GPU. Factually, the 3Dcoin architecture is environnement friendly.

 Furthermore, unlike most other networks, the 3Dcoin development team is focused on upgrading the network along with its consensus protocol to propagate faster network speeds and promote scalability. Our goal is to become the new generation blockchain application platform.  

##  **Network status system**

 This system is constituted by a set of synchronized lists holding data that is important for the functionning of the network. Nodes cast signed votes to set a consensual value for each element of all list.

 Nodes have a private/pubkey pair they must use each time when attempting to perform value defining actions on the network. Everything from broadcasting transaction votes, to synchronizing request, to registering up time, and payments.

###  **Types** 

 	**Payment order status list** (hosted in master nodes only, synchronized every 5 minutes): Nodes are assembled in a cycling Payment list , every time a block is mined, the five nodes on the top of the list will get an equal share of the block reward, all of them get relegated to the bottom of the list, new commers are also directly placed at the bottom, once a node recieves its first payment, the 25k collateral becomes unlocked an can be spent without the loss of the node state. 	

 	**Activity status list** (hosted in master nodes only, synchronized every 5 minutes)**:** The network status system monitores node activity indicators (ping, performance ...), will set a **performance score** for Nodes, which according to preset quality norms, will determine the consequential reward, either full,partial, or null. In the case where a node requires attention, as is when its **ping** is high, its connection **slow** or when it needs to upgrade its **hardware** the network sends a **notification** to the node in question. Every bit of information concerning a node is actively synchronized amongst nodes and updated for every mined block that happens on the network.

 	**Confirmed transactions status list** (hosted in all nodes) : Its main function is the unification of the The real time outputs list among master nodes, secondarely, it is needed by prime and pulse nodes to perform actions that require a recently validated payment.  

 For every recieved transaction (3DCoin, Object or DAPP token), the node broadcasts a signed validity vote to the network and waits for the votes of the reste of the nodes, if at least 95% of the network provides a positive vote, the transaction is added by the nodes to their real time outputs list which will be used in the creation of the next block. Nodes that cast a false vote will be banned. This list belongs to all nodes.

##  **Mining and proof of service:**

 As was noted earlier, running a node capable of performing these functions can be resource intensive. Which is why the 3DCoin node features come with a rewards system that offers incentives for hosting master-nodes. By hosting a 3DCoin node, users are contributing their quota to the propagation of the 3DCoin blockchain and in so doing setting up a mechanism for earning passive income. It’s a win-win situation for investors and the Project Districts ecosystem.

 Proof of service** is implemented to supplent classical proof of work mining or proof of stake , like both it is designed to remove the probability of creating two valid blocks in the same instance, and rewarding contributors to the network. This is achieved by following the consensus that ensures every node will create the same block, while requiring neither the energy wasting of the POW nor the currency staking of the POS. Unlike them, proof of service is performed by master nodes through synchronization.  The real time outputs list being permanently up to date and synchronized at any moment, transaction will be confirmed instantly, even before the mining of the block, to the point where balances will not only be calculated from the blockchain, but also from the Real time outputs list (next blocks transactions list).

 **Proof of service process:**

 -Every 5 minutes, master nodes get triggered to perform a final synchronization of their  real time outputs lists (3DCoin & Object & DAPP chains), from them, they create the three hash roots. Having all the header data, the 3DCoin block is hashed with all the three roots (3DCoin transactions, Objects and DAPPs ). The result, a block that represents the three data sets of the Districts eccosystem. In paralell, Prime and Pulse nodes go through the same process but use only their specific transactions lists (Token) to mine a block with only one root in the header. The result being one global blockchain, and two specific ones.Nodes create their own blocks in parall, but because they have the same synchronized data, all of them will get the exact same block, maintaining the impossibility for double spends, forks, or X% attacks.

 

 **Proof of service steps :**

 

##  **Scripts**

 A script is a collection of instructions defined by the sender that specifies what the receiver must do to unlock the assets (coins) parsed alongside the script. There is no limitation as to the extent and magnitude of scriptable instructions and senders can send as many assets (3dcs) to multiple addresses simultaneously. There is also provisions for senders to distribute multiple amounts at specific time periods (with the option to set expiry dates) or incorporate additional computation requirements as is a generic puzzle or a value calculated by the 3DC network from an external API (eg. A DHL tracking number, food delivery token, hotel room availability etc.) Note however that these parameters can only be set for standard 3DC addresses. The users can choose to disable the scripts by creating a non-script address, The network uses the address to check if the required data is available before starting the validating process(see below).

 `GetRequiredData(Standard) returns 'Timestamp''APIrequest''APIvalidData''CheckStatus''PKHash''Sig'`

 `GetData(tx) == 'Timestamp''CheckStatus''PKHash''Sig'`

 Note that the 'APIrequest' 'APIvalidData' is missing in GetData output, but the data is still valid because the GetRequiredData is representing the whole acceptable scripts by the standard address.

 The network now verifies the data of an input in that order to optimize the computing steps, for example: if the timestamp condition is not valid, the network updates the transaction state to "pending" and the validation process will be automatically stopped.

##  **External/Public API**

 When there is a need to verify certain conditions in complex transactions users can integrate any public API onto the 3DC blockchain. The network will randomly select 10 nodes that will connect to the API server and update the transaction status as required. A node is selected for each update from the public API server to prevent spamming or miss use. The status will be updated according to the external API request limits and then synchronized between nodes on the blockchain.

##  **Sub Currencies**  

 Users can also create Non-fungible assets using 3DCoin core wallet application. Creation of these assets which can be used as tokens, shares, coupons or any other entity of value is a non-reversible process that creates a sub currency (asset). As an example, a user can decide to create 100 SC representative of a companyʼs stock. These sub currencies can then be distributed among participating shareholders as a placeholder of value (stock). In the blockchain, Tokens are saved as transaction marked to be special among normal ones, 

## **Districts land allocation**

 To deploy their Districts 3D DAPPs, users have the option of selecting land parcels contained in either the pre-portioned or pre-categorized segments of the Districts 3D world, where land dimension are present or in a District Sandbox where they can freely specify a preferred location and size. The first 25 land tokens representing the first ring of platforms in the 3D world will be ascribed to top investors. Every other parcel will have to be purchased with 3DCoins either from the Districts network, in which case the 3DCoins will go to the shareholders, or to other users.

##  **Decentralized applications**

 Decentralized applications are the functional units of the Districts ecosystem. They are the primary value proposition of the Districts 3D world, and it is through them that all segments of the Districts experience will come to life. A DAPP is comprised of two segments

-  	The Unreal 4	visual engine, encoded using an Unreal Engine library and part of 	Districts client.
-  	A  script fashioned by Districtʼs visual script encoding platform, 	parsed in a data capsule and hosted in every Prime node, and 	**registred** in the DAPP blockchain.

 In practice, this configuration allows the blockchain network to run ‘lightʼ and with minimal bandwidth, since resource intensive properties, like textures, 3D modelling, etc. are served from the client end.

 Ownership of a Decentralized application is defined by a Token which securely stores the details of the DAPPs data capsule. By default DAPPs can be used freely by any user, creators can, however, set specific conditions and requirements that define how a DAPP can be accessed or used. Owners can also modify a DAPPs script (as would be necessary for the event of a transfer of ownership). Modifications will be broadcasted on the Districts blockchain as an updated scripted transaction subject to verification by a network consensus. If a script possesses unrecognized functions the updating attempt will be rejected.

## Districts visual studio

 DVS is a modern, comprehensive, and robust IDE, comparable to the Ethereal developer portal presented in a fluid and easy to use interface. This minimalist interface features an easy to use drag and drop creation mode that allows users to select and implement a variety of functions such as texturization, scheduling custom animations or even visual scripting by simply ‘dragging and droppingʼ using a mouse or through VR controllers. Complex model interactions and trigger properties are defined as a tree of processes and conditions in an interactive map which when completed is parsed into the application by the DVS. DVS also come bundled with a diverse and expandable library of functions, textures, sound and 3D modelling templates that make the job of building and commissioning a DAPP all the more easier. Interactive tutorials that walk every user through the DAPP creation process will be found in the starting area of the Districts 3D world. In addition, a dedicated forum section where users can ask questions and contribute answers to other users will also be set up to foster seamless operation of the DVS module. Before final release, content creators can test run their finished DAPPs in offline mode, if the test phase is successful, an encoded script is generated by the DVS and stored in data capsule. Subsequent modifications to the DAPP can be effectuated by compiling add-on scripts which will then be incorporated as updates to the Districts library.

## Content acquisition and payment 

 Like was noted earlier, ownership of a virtual asset and clearance to use such an asset or service is defined by a scripted transaction. When a third party purchases the right to use a DAPP (in the case of curated contents) the ownership function previously defined at the point of creation of the DAPP creates a DAPP token that houses a specific script. DAPPS are by default configured to check for and then authenticate the token meta data before granting the user access.

 Once the decentralized application is completed, a land parcel in the 3D world must be acquired to receive the virtual structure that will host it.

## Conclusion: The Districts 3D world

 The final piece needed to complete the Districts Jigsaw puzzle was its 3D world and to create this the development team made use of the unreal engine. After parsing the resultant product with the aforementioned technologies/features the result was the fully fledged Districts ecosystem – a thoroughly immersive VR/AR platform reinforced by the core efficiencies of blockchain technology.

 Districts launch as the first entirely free for use in virtual and augmented reality world with broad-spectrum capabilities and a limitless ecosystem. The Districts experience is an ethereal one, more importantly, however, it is the class definition of what being user-friendly should feel like. Districtʼs Visual Script (DVS) makes it possible for users with little or no programming experience to develop complex DAPPs, an industry first that broadens the reach and penetration of the 3D world allowing for the participation of users from all spheres of life. Furthermore, the inclusion of a custom scripted in-house payments solution in the form of 3DCoin obliterates the traditional limitations associated with 21st-century payments processing. This and more sets District ahead of the pack in the race for VR/AR dominance. While competitors are stymied by limitations in areas of ease of usage and technical competence, Districts surpass all set benchmarks for functionality and excellence. As technology continues to evolve so also will the Districts ecosystem, the goal is to keep pioneering innovation by improving existing architectures and incorporating newer technologies – come 2025 Districts plans to be the lead player in the collective worlds of virtual and augmented reality.
