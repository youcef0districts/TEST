# Users guide

~~Whether you are a veteran or new to the cryptocurrencies world, this guide will leave no one behind.~~

As you already know, your 3DCoins are not stored in your PC or mobile phone, nor a central server simulating a bank, but they are indeed securely saved in the collectively protected data structure called blockchain.

You will certainly want know the amount of coins you possess, and the ability to spend them as you please, and especially, as often as possible, receive allot of precious 3DCoins. Currency management options are all done through a simple tool, the Wallet.

In most of your online activities, you are required to have accounts and be logged in to sites. People and apps interact with you by your user name (either real or a nick). in the blockchain there is no user name, but keys. creating your key will be your first use of the wallet, your first step into being a 3DCoin tycoon.

The journey starts here! [Web Wallet](https://3dcoin.online/#home)
